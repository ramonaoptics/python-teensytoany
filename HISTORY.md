* Provide a static method to program the latest firmware version and a CLI to
  do so from the terminal.

## 0.3.0 (2024-04-02)

* Add a `timeout` property to the functions that deal with updating the firmware.

## 0.2.0 (2023-11-07)

* Add a `timeout` property to simplify modifying the command timeout.

## 0.1.0 (2023-09-29)

  latest firmware.

## 0.0.34 (2023-08-26)

* Small fixup in how reading the Teensy's registers is done to ensure better
  forward compatibility.

## 0.0.33 (2023-08-26)

The following features require teensy-to-any version 0.0.23 or greater
* Add support for `gpio_digital_pulse`.
* Add support for `analog_pulse`.
* Add support for new `value` parameter for `gpio_pin_mode`.
* Add support to read the data returned from `spi_transfer_bulk`.

## 0.0.32 (2023-08-30)

  a timeout.

## 0.0.29 (2023-03-06)
